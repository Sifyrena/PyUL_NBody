# Python Library Prerequisites

The code requires the following standard Python libraries

    numba, numexpr, pyfftw, multiprocessing
  
as well as up-to-date versions of
  
    scipy, matplotlib

In order to enable media output capabilities, you need a properly configured distribution of 

    ffmpeg

# The ULDM File Type

.ULDM files are generated by the code as intermediary, human-readable, configuration files. They are just plain text using UTF-8 encoding. Some special uldm files (config.uldm and reproducibility.uldm) are plain JSON files.

# Basic Command Line Usage

PyUltraLight 2 operates on similar user-interactivity logic as other command-line based simulation codes. The simplest operation assumes one has a config.uldm file enclosed in /PATH_TO_FOLDER/FOLDER.

Working at the root directory of PyUltraLight2, one may issue the following Python commands in a terminal:

```python

import PyUltraLight2 as PyUL
PyUL.evolve('/PATH_TO_FOLDER','FOLDER')

```

You will be prompted to pick an axion mass (e.g. 1e-22) upon the first import of the PyUL library.

The ``evolve`` method contains several optional settings, and a brief summary is supplied below


| Flag | Type and Default Value | Explanation |

EdgeClear=False,  # Reflexive Boundary Condition (Half Baked)
    DumpInit=False,  # Dump Initial Wavefunction
    DumpFinal=False,  # Dump Final Wavefunction
    UseInit=False,  # Use Initial Wavefunction (Specify in InitPath)
    IsoP=False,  # Use Zero Padded Potential
    UseDispSponge=False,  # Dispersive Sponge Boundary Condition
    SelfGravity=True, # ULDM Feels Own Gravity
    NBodyInterp=True, # N body Particle Feels ULDM Gravity
    NBodyGravity=True,# ULDM Feels N body Gravity
    Silent=False,  # Quiet Mode
    AutoStop=False,  # Stop simulation with BH
    AutoStop2=False,  # Stop when ULDM gravitational field strength becomes unstable by
    WellThreshold=100,  # this much.
    InitPath=InitPath,  # 
    InitWeight=1, # Blend factor of loaded Wavefunction (Set InitWeight to -1 to utilize the phase only)
    Stream=False,  # Write RK Step Results To File (Not Used)
    StreamChar=[1, 4])  # Locations in the vectorized TMState to Stream. (x-y flipped).
