# Purpose of the Library, and Current Capabilities

To evolve a rigid N body particle ensemble and a mesh-based ULDM cluster in time, against an non-expanding background, with flexible settings, good energy-conservation, and easy expandability.

The main integrator is currently capable of generating 

* N body position and velocity state vectors, and
* ULDM density, gravitational field strength, momentum, angular momentum, and energy.

While the supplied auxillary functions can also produce

* System energy and entropy,
* N body orbital properties, and
* Estimates of dynamical friction force and related timescales.

The Jupyter notebooks shipped with the integrator contain a minimal analysis suite that is capable of plotting N body orbits, ULDM density contours and ULDM phases. In addition, a guide on how to save and process these files will be included in the later section.


# Known Issues

* In the current version, if you rely on the included generative functions to initialise your simulation, there is a chance that your x and y coordinates may be swapped. **Temporary Remedy:** Call ``PyUL.VizInit2D(length,length_units,resol,embeds,
              solitons,s_position_unit, s_mass_unit,
              particles,m_position_unit, Uniform, Density, UVel, rP, VScale = 1)`` to generate an 2D preview of the simulation grid.


# Python Library Prerequisites

The code requires the following standard Python libraries

    numba, numexpr, pyfftw, multiprocessing
  
as well as up-to-date versions of
  
    scipy, matplotlib

In order to enable media output capabilities, you need a properly configured distribution of 

    ffmpeg

# The ULDM File Type

.ULDM files are generated by the code as intermediary, human-readable, configuration files. They are just plain text using UTF-8 encoding. Some special uldm files (config.uldm and reproducibility.uldm) are plain JSON files.

# Basic Command Line Usage

PyUltraLight 2 operates on similar user-interactivity logic as other command-line based simulation codes. The simplest operation assumes one has a config.uldm file enclosed in /PATH_TO_FOLDER/FOLDER.

Working at the root directory of PyUltraLight2, one may issue the following Python commands in a terminal:

```python

import PyUltraLight2 as PyUL
PyUL.evolve('/PATH_TO_FOLDER','FOLDER')

```

You will be prompted to pick an axion mass (e.g. 1e-22) upon the first import of the PyUL library.

The ``evolve`` method contains several optional settings, and a brief summary is supplied below
