# Python Library Prerequisites

The code requires the following standard Python libraries

    numba, numexpr, pyfftw, multiprocessing
  
as well as up-to-date versions of
  
    scipy, matplotlib

In order to enable media output capabilities, you need a properly configured distribution of 

    ffmpeg

# The ULDM File Type

.ULDM files are generated by the code as intermediary, human-readable, configuration files. They are just plain text using UTF-8 encoding. Some special uldm files (config.uldm and reproducibility.uldm) are plain JSON files.

# Basic Command Line Usage

PyUltraLight 2 operates on similar user-interactivity logic as other command-line based simulation codes. The simplest operation assumes one has a config.uldm file enclosed in /PATH_TO_FOLDER/FOLDER.

Working at the root directory of PyUltraLight2, one may issue the following Python commands in a terminal:

```python

import PyUltraLight2 as PyUL
PyUL.evolve('/PATH_TO_FOLDER','FOLDER')

```
